From the time, I have been watching EPL and the betting predictions linked to it. I never witnessed a see-saw season, as tale of this season is assumed even more precarious than the start. Chelsea, who started as defender of the title were having an odds of 11/8 to win the title, which after 15 games (sack of mourinho) went to 200/1. On the other side of fortune, Leicester were considered 5000/1 odds good to win their first title at the start, who now stands at the top of table and looking good to finish well.

As the tables gets a swing, so does the <a href="http://www.planetbetng.com/">betting sites and predictions.</a> Letâ€™s surface the reign of classical turnaround, which has still so much for the fun appetite.
